/** Write index files.
 *
 * OutStream objects are the primary interface for writing index files.  They
 * are media-agnostic wrappers around low-level, media-specific, unbuffered
 * FileHandle objects, providing output buffering and routines for writing
 * common constructs such as big-endian or compressed integers.
 *
 * OutStreams are write-once and cannot seek -- they must write all their data
 * in order.  Furthermore, each OutStream is associated with exactly one,
 * unique FileHandle -- unlike InStreams, which can share a common FileHandle.
