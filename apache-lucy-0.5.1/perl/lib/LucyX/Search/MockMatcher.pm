=head1 NAME

LucyX::Search::MockMatcher - Matcher with arbitrary docs and scores.

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

Used for testing combining L<Matchers|Lucy::Search::Matcher> such as
ANDMatcher, MockMatcher allows arbitrary match criteria to be supplied,
obviating the need for clever index construction to cover corner cases.

MockMatcher is a testing and demonstration class; it is unsupported.
