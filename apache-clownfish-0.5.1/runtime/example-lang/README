The "example-lang" directory contains a template for adding a language binding
to Clownfish. To get started, copy "example-lang" to a directory named after
the language you'd like to bind to:

    cp -R example-lang xyz

Most of the C files within the "example-lang/src" directory contain stubs for
routines whose interfaces are defined within "core".

    core/Clownfish/Obj.cfh            # Declares interface.
    core/Clownfish/Obj.c              # all except language-dependent
    example-lang/src/Clownfish/Obj.c  # only language-dependent

Once all the stubs have been implemented correctly, Clownfish will
theoretically build and pass its tests.

There is one pair of files with an interface *not* defined in core.

    example-lang/src/CFBind.h
    example-lang/src/CFBind.c

The CFBind files are there to hold conversion routines which are specific to a
language binding.  Since it is impractical to impose a generic interface, they
are not defined in core.

You may wish to start by referencing a finished language binding to get a feel
for what should go in the CFBind files.
